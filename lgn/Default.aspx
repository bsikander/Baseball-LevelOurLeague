    <h4>What our System offers </h4> 

<p> Hello and welcome to "LevelOurLeague.com"! As a former athlete in many little
league sports for 10 years I have seen how lopsided a league can become with the
"draft" process. The coaches will evaluate and rate players based on a preseason
workout or tryout. Rankings will be given and the coaches will then pick their
teams usually starting with the highest ranking players and working their way down
to the lower ranked players. This is how the process should go, but in my
experience, it usually does not. I have played for over 25 different little league
sports teams/leagues and have always noticed that the draft process could not have
possible worked out exactly that fairly. What usually happens is most coaches are
usually a father of a player in the league or friend of a father whose child plays.
So,before any actual drafting takes place each coach will choose a few choice
players he would like on his team. This is usually done by requesting friends of
their children, relatives, or a kid who may have played well for him in years
before. Each coach will take his pick at a couple or more players that he wants and
then the actual "draft" process begins. I know this because i was a coaches child
or friend of a coaches child on every team I have every played on and know how this
goes on.</p>
<p>What our system will offer is a way to completely balance each organization's
leagues teams based on the average ranking of each player in any category that you
choose based on the sport to rate them may it be batting, fielding, pitching, etc.
using baseball as an example. This can be done for any little league in house
sport. All you will need to do is register your organization and add leagues.
Choose the amount of players that will be in the league and the amount of players
on each team. Take the average of all the coaches evaluation rankings for each
player and punch in into our system and the outcome will be the most balanced
league based on coaches evaluation. There will be an option for the Organization or
league manager to manually change players if needed. This can also help ensure that
in a case where a league may really stack up a team that will be used for later
tournament travel squads to not have the added edge of have kids play together for
months and then going up against a tournament team or another organization picked
using a legitimate drafting process and then choosing their tournament players
after the season as it should be. We are dealing with children here.</p> 
<h4>What you want as a Parent </h4> 
<p>You want your child to have the same opportunities as everyone else, not playing every game in right field because the coach was able to get his son and sons 4 best friends on his team playing all the "action" positions.You want your child to have a team that is competitve each game. You want your child to want to go to his game knowing that his team has a chance to win, and not be discouraged when he/she looks at the schedule to see that they are playing the team beating everyone 10-0.</p> 
   <h4>Here are a list of pros of our system </h4> 
        <ul style="margin-left:42px;"> 
            <li>Ensuring a league that is balanced as perfectly as possible</li>
            <li>Promoting socialization of the children by playing with different kids each
season because players skills do progress or regress year to year</li>
            <li>Equal opportunities for children to be coached as favoritism will be
dramatically reduced</li>
            <li>Credible outcomes of league and tournament team champions</li>
        </ul>
